# XOR ARBITER PUF
Implementation of XOR Arbiter PUF and integration to develop an authentication system to enhance physical security in IoT devices.

**PROJECT DESCRIPTION**
Physical Unclonable Functions (PUFs) on a device represent a low-cost primitive exploiting the unique random patterns in the device and have been already applied in a multitude of applications. Once the key material is extracted, secure key generation and key agreement can be implemented on the device in order to avoid an attacker from taking over the identity of a tampered device. The PUF-based authentication system is developed using XOR Arbiter PUF and is implemented using MATLAB and the uniqueness and uniformity of PUF are evaluated.
